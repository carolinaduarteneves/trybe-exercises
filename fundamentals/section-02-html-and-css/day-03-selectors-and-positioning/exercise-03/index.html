    <h1>My CSS Selectors and Layout Practice</h1>
<p id="hello">Hello!</p>


<p id="first-paragraph">This page was developed as a practice exercise to explore how <span class="css">CSS</span> selectors, positioning techniques, and layout decisions influence the structure of a web page. It is part of my learning process in HTML and <span class="css">CSS</span>, where I focus on understanding how styles can organize content, improve readability, and create visually balanced layouts.
The purpose of this page is not to build a polished or final website, but to experiment, test ideas, and strengthen my foundation in <span class="css">CSS</span> concepts through hands-on practice.</p>

<h2>About This Practice</h2>

<p>In this exercise, the main focus is learning how to control layout using <span class="css">CSS</span>. Selecting elements accurately and positioning them properly allows content to be displayed in a clear, logical, and visually organized way.

This practice helps me understand how styling decisions affect how users perceive, read, and interact with a web page.</p>

<h2>Why CSS Selectors Matter</h2>



<p> 
    <span class="css">CSS</span> selectors make it possible to apply styles to specific elements without affecting the entire page. They help create organized, efficient, and reusable styling rules.
    <br>
    With selectors, I can:
    </p>
    
<ol>
    <li>Target elements precisely</li>
    <li>Apply styles consistently</li>
    <li>Group related elements</li>
    <li>Improve readability and maintenance of the code</li>
</ol>

<h2>Concepts Explored</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <span class="css">CSS</span> selectors and specificity</li>
    <li>Classes and IDs</li>
    <li>Grouped and combined selectors</li>
    <li>Element positioning and layout structure</li>
    <li>Pseudo-classes for interaction and state changes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Visualizing CSS in Practice</h2>

<p> <span class="css">CSS</span> plays an important role in transforming plain content into a visually structured page. Through layout control, spacing, and alignment, it becomes possible to guide the user’s attention and improve the overall experience.

Learning these concepts helps me understand <span class="css">CSS</span> not just as a styling language, but as a powerful tool for structure and communication.</p>

<h2>Image Positioning Practice:</h2>

<div class="examples">



<h4>Example 1 – Centered Image</h4>
<p>In this example, the image should be positioned in the center of the page.
The goal is to practice aligning an image horizontally and vertically in relation to the page or a container.
This example helps me understand how alignment affects layout, how centered elements draw user attention, and how containers influence image positioning.

</p>




<h4>Example 2 – Image Aligned to the Left with Text</h4>

<div class="example-row">
<img src="images/landscape.png" alt="landscape" id="landscape">

<p>In this example, the image should appear on the left side, with text flowing next to it on the right.
This layout is commonly used in articles, blogs, and informational pages.
This practice helps me learn how to align images next to text, how spacing affects readability, and how layout choices impact content flow.

</p>

</div>





<h4>Example 3 – Image Aligned to the Right</h4>
<div class="example-row right">
<img src="images/A majestic icy landscape.png" alt="A majestic icy landscape" id="icy-landscape">

<p>In this example, the image should be placed on the right side of the page, with text on the left.
The objective is to explore how changing alignment alters the visual hierarchy and balance of the page.
This example allows me to experiment with visual symmetry and contrast, different layout compositions, and user reading patterns.
</p>

</div>


<h4>Example 4 – Image Inside a Box or Card</h4>
<p>
In this example, the image should be placed inside a box or card-like section.
The goal is to practice positioning images within a container and controlling spacing around them.
This exercise helps reinforce the relationship between images and containers, how padding and margins affect layout, and how images behave inside structured sections.

</p>



<h4>Example 5 – Overlapping Images</h4>
<p> In this example, multiple images are intentionally placed on top of each other.
    The goal is to practice image overlapping using CSS positioning and stacking order.
    This exercise helps me understand how <strong>position</strong> and <strong>z-index</strong>
    work together, how elements are layered on the page, and how overlapping visuals
    can be used to create depth, focus, and more dynamic layouts.

    <img src="images/alligator.png" alt="Realistic head of an alligator" id="alligator">
    <img src="images/bird.png" alt="A realistic small bird" id="bird">
 
</div>

</div>




<p id="note">
Note:
These examples are meant to be styled using different <span class="css">CSS</span> positioning and layout techniques. The goal is to experiment, test variations, and observe how each positioning choice changes the overall structure of the page.
<br>
Practicing image positioning helps build confidence in layout design and strengthens my understanding of <span class="css">CSS</span> as a tool for visual organization.
