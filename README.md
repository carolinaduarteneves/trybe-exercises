# Trybe Exercises Repository

## About this repository

This repository contains exercises and small projects developed during my studies at Trybe, a technology education school focused on software development.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey, practice programming concepts, and build a solid foundation in software development.  
Each folder represents a specific module, section, and day of study, following an organized structure to reflect my progress over time.

This repository serves as a learning log and an evolving portfolio of my technical growth.
